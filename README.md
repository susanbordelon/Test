<p>Maddie B's is a family owned restaurant that started in our great grandmother's kitchen.  The recipes were handed down from many  
generations ago and Maddie B's only uses fresh fruit and vegetables; grass-fed meat; and fresh dairy to whip up these mouth watering
dishes that will leave you wanting more.</p>

<p>Maddie B's is located on the Boardwalk overlooking the Galveston Bay.  Our bay windows allow our guests to enjoy their meal while  
watching the waves crash or soaking in the sunset.  Our open patio allows for a cool breeze on warmer afternoons to catch a football game 
while enjoying one of our famous Bloody Mary's.  Maddie B's will become your favorite home away from home.</p>
