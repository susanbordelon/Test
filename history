<h2>The History of Maddie B's</h2>
<p>Maddie B's was created from the thoughts and ideas of the family members from the Bordelon family.
Marty Bordelon aka "MoMo" was a Caddo Adai Indian that had family recipes that had been passed down
to her from her grandmother.  She married a south Louisiana man from Cajun country that a certain spice
to the recipes that were already loved.  Marty passed these loved recipes to Maddie B who took them
and figured their secret.</p>

<p>Maddie B has taken the beloved dishes from Marty and added her own flare to them.  These southern 
dishes bring love, warmth and family from our table to yours.</p>
